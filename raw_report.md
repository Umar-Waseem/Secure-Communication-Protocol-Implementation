## Challenges Faced

- Had to understand how to proceed with making a client server architecture
- Had to understand which libraries to use for the project
- Had to look for libraries for the particular encryption and cryptographic algorithm
- Had to consider strength of the algorithm and the time complexity of the algorithm while keeping in mind the system resources
- Had to understand what are cipher suits and how they are used to agree on a particular encryption algorithm, key exchange algorithm and authentication algorithm between the client and the server
- Had to understand how to generate a server private key
- Had to understand how to generate a server certificate and sign it yourself
